## Boost Crawling & Indexing

### 1. Add More Content/Pages

**Problem:** Single-page React app = Only 1 URL in sitemap
**Solution:** Add more pages or blog content

**Quick win - Add static pages:**
```
/about
/contact
/meetings
/testimonials
/resources
```

Each new page = more URLs = more crawling opportunities

---

### 2. Get Backlinks

**Why:** Backlinks tell Google your site is important and should be crawled more

**Easy backlinks:**
1. **Facebook Business Page:**
   - Add website link to your Facebook page
   - Post links to your website regularly

2. **Local Directories:**
   - Google My Business (must have!)
   - Yelp for Churches/Nonprofits
   - Local recovery directories
   - San Diego community resources

3. **Casa de Oro Bible Church Website:**
   - Add link to Life Recovery program
   - Create dedicated page linking to liferecoverysd.org

4. **Recovery Community:**
   - AA meeting lists
   - NA meeting directories
   - Faith-based recovery directories

---

### 3. Create Google My Business Profile

**Critical for local SEO!**

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://business.google.com
2. Create listing for:
   - **Name:** Life Recovery at Casa de Oro Bible Church
   - **Address:** 10195 Madrid Way, Spring Valley, CA 91977
   - **Category:** Religious Organization / Support Group
   - **Website:** https://liferecoverysd.org
   - **Phone:** (619) 414-6985
   - **Hours:** Friday 6:00 PM - 7:30 PM

**Benefits:**
- Shows up in Google Maps
- Appears in local searches
- Signals to Google to crawl your site more
- Drives direct traffic

---

### 4. Social Signals

**Post content regularly:**

**Facebook:**
- Weekly meeting reminders
- Testimonies (with permission)
- Recovery resources
- Each post should link to: https://liferecoverysd.org

**Why this helps:**
- Social signals tell Google site is active
- Referral traffic increases crawl frequency
- More people searching for your site = Google crawls more

---

### 5. Internal Linking (For Future)

If you add more pages, link them together:
```
Home ‚Üí About ‚Üí Contact ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí Back to Home
```

Google follows links to discover pages.

## Why This Is Happening

**Your site is brand new (added Sept 12, 2025):**
- Google doesn't know you exist yet
- No backlinks = low authority
- No traffic = no signals to crawl more

**Single page application:**
- Only 1 URL in sitemap
- Limited content for Google to index

**Solution:**
- Force Google to notice you (request indexing)
- Get backlinks to build authority
- Add more content/pages over time
- Stay consistent with updates
