## üîç Google Search Console Fix

### Why Search Console wasn't fetching:

1. **Missing verification:** Site wasn't verified in Search Console
2. **No Analytics:** Missing tracking prevented Google from monitoring site

### How the fixes help:

1. **Verification tag added:** Google can now verify ownership
2. **Analytics installed:** Google can track site activity
3. **Better performance:** Faster loading improves crawlability
4. **Structured data:** Already present (excellent!)
5. **Sitemap:** Already submitted via Netlify plugin

### After configuration:

1. Verify your site in Search Console
2. Submit sitemap: https://liferecoverysd.org/sitemap.xml
3. Request indexing for main pages
4. Monitor "Coverage" report for any issues
5. Check "Page Experience" for Core Web Vitals

```

### Manual deployment:
